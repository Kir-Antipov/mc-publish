The `Publish Minecraft Mods` action helps you upload assets of your Minecraft mods to GitHub Releases, Modrinth and CurseForge. This is a cross-platform action that runs on any environment.

### üìñ Usage

Most of the values are automatically resolved *(read further for more info)*. Therefore, here's all you really need to publish your mod:

```yml
jobs:
  build:
    # ...
    steps:
      - uses: Kir-Antipov/mc-publish@v3.1
        with:
          # You don't need this section if you don't want to publish
          # your assets to Modrinth
          modrinth-id: AANobbMI
          modrinth-token: ${{ secrets.MODRINTH_TOKEN }}

          # You don't need this section if you don't want to publish
          # your assets to CurseForge
          curseforge-id: 394468
          curseforge-token: ${{ secrets.CURSEFORGE_TOKEN }}

          # You don't need this section if you don't want to publish
          # your assets to GitHub
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### üìñü¶ú Unnecessary Verbose Example

Please, **do not** consider the following example as something you should use. `mc-publish` was made to be as zero-configy as possible, you just do not need all this. It's here to show you most of the available inputs in the form of an actual configuration. It not only hurts me on a spiritual level to see configurations with hardcoded values that could be automatically resolved, but sometimes people copy-paste inputs that will break their workflows, e.g., I saw someone trying to use `github-discussion: Announcements` in repo that had neither "Announcements" discussion category, nor discussions in general. [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) in action - if you don't see a reason to use an input, just don't use it. With all that said, let's get back to our unnecessary verbose example:

```yml
jobs:
  build:
    # ...
    steps:
      - uses: Kir-Antipov/mc-publish@v3.1

Note, that you can use any top-level property *(`name`, `version`, `dependencies`, `files`, etc.)* as a target-specific one. This can help you fine-tune `mc-publish` to suit your tastes and needs. For example, consider the following configuration:

```yaml
# It is a good idea to share the same primary file among different targets
files-primary: build/libs/!(*-@(dev\|sources\|javadoc)).jar

modrinth-id: aaaAAAaa
modrinth-token: ${{ secrets.MODRINTH_TOKEN }}
# Modrinth-specific name for your mod
modrinth-name: Modrinth Mod
# Modrinth-specific secondary files
modrinth-files-secondary: build/libs/*-@(dev\|sources\|javadoc).jar
# Modrinth-specific dependencies
# It is possible to use project ids instead of slugs
modrinth-dependencies: |
  AANobbMI | depends | *
  sodium

curseforge-id: 0
curseforge-token: ${{ secrets.CURSEFORGE_TOKEN }}
# CurseForge-specific name for your mod
curseforge-name: CurseForge Mod
# CurseForge-specific secondary files
curseforge-files-secondary: ""
# CurseForge-specific dependencies
# It is not possible to use project ids instead of slugs
curseforge-dependencies: |
  sodium | depends | *
```

 - `subset` - only those Modrinth versions which are considered a subset of the new one *(i.e., new release suports all of the version's mod loaders **and** game versions)* will be unfeatured
 - `intersection` - only those Modrinth versions which intersects with the new one *(i.e., support at least one of the mod loaders and one of the game versions supported by the new release)* will be unfeatured
 - `any` - all Modrinth versions will be unfeatured

```

As you can see, each dependency should be written on a new line using the following format - `{id} | {kind=depends} | {version=*}`.

Available dependency kinds:
 - `depends` - for dependencies required to run. Without them a game will crash.
 - `recommends` - for dependencies not required to run. Without them a game will log a warning.
 - `suggests` - for dependencies not required to run. Can be used as a kind of metadata.
 - `includes` - for dependencies embedded into the mod. Can be used as a kind of metadata.
 - `conflicts` - for mods whose together with yours cause some kind of bugs, etc. With them a game will log a warning.
 - `breaks` - for mods whose together with yours might cause a game crash. With them a game will crash.

Can be automatically retrieved from the config file of your mod:

- `fabric.mod.json` (Fabric)
  ```json

#### java

A list of supported Java versions. It's omitted by default.

```yaml
java: |
  8
  16
  Java 17
```

#### retry-attempts

The maximum number of attempts to publish assets.

```yaml
retry-attempts: 2
```

#### retry-delay

Time delay between attempts to publish assets (in milliseconds).

```yaml
retry-delay: 10000
```

#### fail-mode

Determines how errors that occur during mod publishing process are handled. Default value is `fail`.

```yaml
fail-mode: fail
```

Available values:

 - `fail` - immediately sets the action status to **failed** and terminates its execution
 - `warn` - warns about errors. The action won't be terminated, nor its status will be set to **failed**
 - `skip` - warns about errors. The action won't be terminated, but its status will be set to **failed** after all specified targets have been processed
