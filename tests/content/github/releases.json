New key binds:\r\n   - `Extract from item` - Extracts item(s) from the selected inventory-providing item\r\n   - `Toggle interaction mode (hold)` - Makes the `Interact with item` key bind behave like `Extract from item`\r\n - User experience was drastically improved:\r\n   - The cursor now preserves its position when you switch between different screens\r\n   - The said screens no longer jump all around you monitor, because I addressed all those off-by-one errors in GUI rendering that Mojang couldn't be bothered to fix. *(Yes, Mojang, we believe you care about that cOnsIstEnCy of yours so much, especially when looking at the 9x3 Ender Chest inventory screen, which is two pixels bigger than the exact same 9x3 Shulker Box inventory screen; now, please, go take your pills.)*\r\n - Better compatibility with other mods, thanks to [MixinExtras](https://github.com/LlamaLad7/MixinExtras)\r\n - New icon\r\n\r\n### Fixes:\r\n\r\n - Fixed a bug where an incorrect inventory view could appear when the `Interact with item` key bind is triggered from the hotbar\r\n - Inventory-only key binds no longer override global ones\r\n - Removed unnecessary NBT entries from empty Shulker Boxes, making them once again compatible with features like `stackableShulkerBoxes` from the [Carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) mod\r\n - Fixed compatibility issues with `EnchantedShulkers` ([#7](https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/packed-inventory/issues/7))\r\n - Fixed compatibility issues with `EnderChests` ([#12](https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/packed-inventory/issues/12))\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes:\r\n\r\n -
